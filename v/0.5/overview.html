<h1><b><span lang=IT style='font-family:Helvetica'>Description</span></b></h1>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Architecture, Engineering, Construction,
Operation (AECO) and Facility Management (FM) industry is a collaborative
environment with the involvement of multiple disciplines and activities
throughout the building lifecycle process (Karlapudi et al. 2020). This
collaboration requires the iterative and cooperated exchange of information,
and improves the building design over multiple lifecycle stages (Abualdenien and Borrmann 2018; Abualdenien and Borrmann 2019). </span><span
lang=EN-GB>The successful representation of these information refinements at
each BLS </span><span lang=EN-GB>enables the identification of the required
level of detail for data export or import parameters between the multiple disciplines.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Since the last decade, LOD is a promising
approach for efficient representation of semantically rich BIM data in
different levels of detail. </span><span lang=EN-GB>The defined LOD levels from
the different national standards or code of practices aim to describe the
granularity and the sequential refinement of both the geometric and semantics
information about an object (Hooper 2015). This methodological approach assists to track the improved changes or
refinements of the building objects throughout the different phases of the
building design.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Despite the improvement, there is a lack of
successful implementation and management of LOD functionalities within the
existing BIM solutions (Papadonikolaki et al. 2018). One main issue is the insufficient understanding of
diverse frameworks for the adoption and representation of LOD levels. This
research elaborates the extensive analysis of different LOD specifications to
represent information granularity according to the standards. Based on the
analyzed knowledge, further progress to provide a flexible Ontology-based LOD
framework to define information levels according to different available
standard and align with the use-case (IDM concept) requirements involved in the
construction projects.</span></p>

Components for consideration to define the Product-Process Modelling</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Furthermore, In the context of the BIM4EEB
project, BIM is an advanced information technology that should be adopted by
relevant Stakeholders to perform efficient renovation of existing buildings.
These stakeholders are performing their Activities with the use of the BIM model
for managing the information produced during the renovation processes
throughout <a name="_Hlk17902419">Building Lifecycle Stages </a>(BLS), in a
common format and to enable the best and most efficient use of the information <span lang=DE>(Karlapudi et al. 2020)</span></span><span lang=DE>. The inherited  LOD
concept is used to represent and/or filter these information refinements
produced in different stages and as </span><span lang=EN-GB>well to verify the
compliance of generated information models. From the scope of the BIM4EEB
project, this article elaborates the developed ontology for representing the
product modelling support of different LOD levels and their integration to
BIM4EEB workflow ontologies. By summarising the abovementioned scope, this
research is considered six components/domains which are represented in Figure 1
for the definition of the “Digital Construction Lifecycle (DICL)” ontology. </span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The layout represented in Figure 1 is defining
a 6-dimensional space where all of those components are related to each other. In
the BIM4EEB project, there is the exact number of identified stakeholders, who
are acting in activities of renovation processes. Stakeholders dealing with
BIM-related data represented with specific LOD in different BLS. Activities, LOD
and BIM entities are related to these Stages. Moreover, a concept is developed to
simplify the understanding and to merge stakeholders’ activities into the 3 larger
sets – called Use Cases.</span></p>

<h1><b><span lang=IT style='font-family:Helvetica'>Overview</span></b></h1>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The overview of the developed ontology is
presented in two parts. The first part of the research work completely focused
on the LOD structures from various standards or publications, which
substantially supports tracking and record the granularity of the objects. In
the second part, the research concentrated on the LOD based BIM data management
in workflow ontologies. The final development goal is a “Digital Construction
Lifecycle (DICL)” or “Lifecycle” ontology which describes clearly activities,
tasks, and sequences, their interrelation to stakeholders involved and the
required information, etc. </span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Within this article, the Ontology Visual
Notations from (Garijo and Poveda-Villalón 2020) are adopted to represent the Lifecycle ontology. Figure
2 and Figure 3 comprehensively illustrating the taxonomy of ontology structure
corresponding to Classes and Data properties respectively. Later in the
development phase, the representation is elaborated regarding the relations
between the classes using object properties. In the development process of
lifecycle ontology, the classes from the other BIM4EEB workflow ontologies are
also used. The ideology is to reduce the redundancy and repetition of ontology
concepts within the BIM4EEB onology suite.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>An analysis of various LOD systems according
to the standard of practices or national norms is carried out as a part of the
initial study. Based on the results from this analysis a conclusion is drawn on
flexible usage of these frameworks into the construction project irrespective
of standards and the region of work. It also identified the basic requirement
that needs to be addressed in the ontology representation of the LOD framework.
The analysis of various LOD systems further leads to different implementation
requirements which need to be defined by the ontology-based frameworks. The
concept called Competency Questions (CQ) is used to list out these requirements
in terms of natural language questions. </span><span lang=EN-US>These CQs are
used as bases </span><span lang=EN-GB>for the development of </span><span
lang=EN-US>ontology structure, concepts and properties.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The development of an ontology framework for
LOD representation is progressed towards providing all the answers for these
requirements (CQ’s). From the general analysis of different LOD systems, a
methodological ontology schema is developed and illustrated in Figure 4. Since
different renovation projects can adopt different LOD systems, the developed
ontological structure of the LOD framework can accommodate the different
standard of representations. The methodological idea is to represent LOD
systems and their levels scale as classes, which can then be instantiated on a
project-to-project basis. The class dicl:LODFramework can be instantiated with
the frameworks called USA BIMForum, UK LOD, Italian LOD, etc. Similarly, the
levels in different frameworks are added as instances to the class dicl:LODLevel.
Later on, the link between the framework and its respective levels are
generated using the object property dicl:hasLevel and its inverse property dicl:isLevelOf.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, relationships between the
levels of a framework are indicated using the transitive object properties
dicl:hasNextLevel, dicl:hasSubLevel and their inverse properties
dicl:hasPreviousLevel, dicl:hasSuperLevel respectively. A property
characteristic called owl:TransitiveProperty is defined for these properties in
order to represent the aggregation relationship between levels. Similarly, a
sub-property chain axiom (dicl:hasLevel <span style='color:#2E74B5'>o</span>
dicl:hasSubLevel </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:#2E74B5'>→</span><span lang=EN-US> dicl:hasLevel) is assigned to the
object properties dicl:hasLevel to define semantic interpretation between the
levels and LOD subtypes.</span></p>

Ontology-based LOD framework</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Furthermore, the research is extended with
an ideology, how and can the paradigm of lifecycle data management introduce in
the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) industry. From
the analysis of LOD requirements corresponding to the BIM data management, a
representational schema for ontology development is generated and illustrated
in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Figure 5</span><span lang=EN-GB>. The development
goal of integrated lifecycle ontology is to clearly describe the different
activities, tasks, and sequences, their interrelations to stakeholders
involved, the required information, other resources, etc. The developed
methodological schema results in the 6-dimensional intercommunication framework
including Activity, Stakeholder, BLS, LOD, BIM data and Use case. This schema
also expresses the relationship between these six aspects of the building
renovation process.</span></p>

Building Product Data management</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In Figure 6, the class dice:BuildingObject
is used to represent the building objects. This class is related to the class
dicv:Subject by an equivalent property. The defined classes dicv:Property and<a
href="https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/opm/#PropertyState"><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none'> dicv:PropertyState</span></a> makes it possible to add
an ultimate number of properties to building objects and their growth of
accuracy throughout the project life-cycle. In detail, the object property is
indicated by the class dicv:Property and the growth of the value of this
property is comprehensively indicated in different property states using the
class dicv:PropertyState. The relationship between these classes is represented
by object property dicv:hasPropertyState. Additionally, these classes support
defining meta-data attributes for each property (e.g. role or quantity kind,
unit, value) and each property state (e.g. source, timestamp, value, unit, etc.).
This property definition capabilities are attached to the object using the
object property dich:hasProperty and its inverse property dicv:isPropertyOf.
This specification of Objectification of the properties also supports the
modelling relationship between LOD and BIM attributes by using the object
property dicl:hasLODLevel and its respective inverse property dicl:isLODLevelOf.
This relationship making it possible to represent the property value at its
corresponding LOD level.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Additionally, the ontology structure also
provides the capability to indicate the source for each growth of information
(property values) and their LOD levels. This has been achieved by developing a
relationship between the dici:InformationContainers (documents, models, files,
etc.) and dicv:PropertyState. This relationship is developed using the object
property called dicl:isDerivedFrom. Another important criterion is to develop a
relationship between the LOD-based BIM data and the activities that required
this data to perform a certain action. This relationship is indicated by using
the object property dicp:hasObject and its inverse property dicp:isObjectIn.
The same relation is represented in </span><span
lang=EN-GB>Figure 7</span><span lang=EN-GB> and explains the information
regarding the required object data for each activity. Which furtherly inherits
the required level of data for each activity within the building lifecycle
stages of the building.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US><img
border=0 width=470 height=215 id="Picture 42" src="overview.fld/image007.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoCaption><a name="_Toc73625830"></a><a name="_Ref73354490"><span
lang=EN-GB>Figure </span></a><span lang=EN-GB>7</span><span lang=EN-GB>.
Building Process Data management</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>The class dica:Agent in Figure 7 specifies
all actors/stakeholders involved in the building renovation process. </span><span
lang=EN-GB>Figure 7 also representing the </span><span lang=EN-GB>role of
different stakeholders involved in the renovation interventions or activities. The
stakeholder roles are categorized dependent on data development, process and
consumption activities. A class dicl:informationalRole is defined as subclass
to dice:Role to substantially accommodate different roles, such are dicl:InformationConsumer,
dicl: InformationProcessor, dicl: InformationProvider (represented in Figure 2).
The specific Role of an agent assigned to him through the object property
dice:hasRole and its inverse property dice:isRoleOf. Similarly, a simple
relationship is defined between activity and the agent by using the object
property dica:hasAgent and its respective inverse property dica:isAgentIn.
Furthermore, the object property dica:isAgentIn is categorized into three
sub-properties dicl:consumesFrom, dicl:providesTo and dicl:processFrom, which
are used based on the role of the agent.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Furthermore, in the lifecycle ontology, a
Use-case representation is used as a grouping mechanism to represent the set
activities involved in a specific process. That means a use-case indicates
different activities in different BLS and their required data to complete a
specific process in a building renovation scenario. Concerning the lifecycle
ontology development, it is also an important parameter to represent this
grouping mechanism within the ontology representation. A class dicl:InformationalUsecase
is considered and provided a relationship with dice:Activity by using object
property called dicl:hasRepresents and its inverse property
dicl:isRepresentedIn</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>In common practice, the activities are
listed according to the BLS of the project. In WP2 Deliverable D2.1, an
extensive analysis is carried in on this list of involved activities for
building renovation in each Building lifecycle stage. These analysis results
are considered for the further development of ontology representation. This relationship
between the BLS and the Activities in Lifecycle ontology framework is
represented with the help of object property called dicl:hasActivity and its
inverse property dicl:isActivityIn. The same relationship is comprehensively
illustrated in </span><span lang=EN-GB>Figure 7</span><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US><img
border=0 width=470 height=333 id="Picture 36" src="overview.fld/image008.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoCaption><a name="_Toc73625832"></a><a name="_Ref70058839"><span
lang=EN-GB>Figure </span></a><span lang=EN-GB>8</span><span lang=EN-GB>. </span><span
lang=EN-GB>BLS ontology framework</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>Additionally, an intense analysis is carried
on the BLS framework according to the different standards of specifications for
categorization of the building renovation process. The specification of BL
stages is necessary for each construction project to manage and assess
engineering services. However, the standard stages in the project differ from
country to country and may also be subjected to differences in legislation.</span></p>

<p class=BodyText><span lang=EN-GB>So the ontology structure is further
extended to BLS representations according to different standards, publications,
user-defined or project-based specifications. The adopted methodology is similar
to the LOD framework ontology in terms of assigning the stages as a class
(dicl:BLStage). It provides the relationship between the stages using the
object properties called dicl:hasSubStage, dicl:hasNextStage and their respective
inverse properties dicl:hasSuperStage, dicl:hasPreviousStage. Similarly, the
transitive character of the properties is enabled by assigning owl:TransitiveProperty
to these object property which further enables the aggregated relationships
between the stages. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=IT>In addition to the property characteristics,
some axioms are defined to achieve the complete semantic meaning of BLS stages
into an ontological framework. These defined axioms are clearly illustrated in </span><span lang=IT>Figure 13</span><span lang=IT>. In an example scenario of BS EN 16310
framework, each stage is comprised of many sub-stages and technically these
sub-stages are also stages to that framework. This semantic meaning is inferred
in ontology with the help of the subProperty chain axiom (</span><span lang=IT
style='font-family:Courier'>dicl:hasStage <span style='color:#2E74B5'>o</span>
dicl:hasSubStage </span><span lang=IT style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:#2E74B5'>→</span><span lang=IT style='font-family:Courier'> dicl:hasStage</span><span
lang=IT>) defined to the object property dicl:hasStage. Similarly, in the same
scenario, the main stage inst:Design (refer Table 7) have a next stage relation
with the substage called inst:Maintenance (refer Table 7) or vice versa. These
complex relations are modelled in the ontology by using axioms </span><span
lang=IT style='font-family:Courier'>dicl:hasNextStage <span style='color:#2E74B5'>o</span>
dicl:hasSubStage </span><span lang=IT style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:#2E74B5'>→</span><span lang=IT style='font-family:Courier'> dicl:hasNextStage,

lang=IT style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#2E74B5'>→</span><span
lang=IT style='font-family:Courier'> dicl:hasPreviousStage</span><span lang=IT>
assigned to properties dicl:hasNextStage, dicl:hasPreviousStage respectively.
Furthermore, the mapping relationships between the stages from different
frameworks are modelled by using the symmetric object property
dicl:isRelaventWith.</span></p>
