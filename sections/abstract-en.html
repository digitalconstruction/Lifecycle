<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Digital Construction Lifecycle ontology provides the terms to represent the evolution of information
about a building over successive building lifecycle stages and refinement of information through
multiple LOD levels. The ontology is able to represent different LOD frameworks such as levels of
detail, levels of development, or levels of definition.
Activities over construction lifecycle can be associated with information flow roles - information
production, processing and consuming - which makes it possible to link
them to appropriate agents.
